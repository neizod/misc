# Miscellaneous

Welcome to misc repository! This is where I kept my quick&dirty mini projects/poc/prototype.

Some of them were developed with web technology, you may view the live demo with this URL pattern:

    https://neizod.github.io/misc/<FILENAME>

Replace `<FILENAME>` part with the actual filename (and with preceding path, if any). Note that file ends with `.md` in GitHub file viewer must be change to `.html` when viewing solely on web browser.


## License

Since this repository is intended to be a collection of throw-away projects, I declare it to be unlicense so anyone who see some value in them can grep-and-go without worrying about the law.

Any other mini projects I concerned about license will be publish separately in its own repository, however.
